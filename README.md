Python implementation of Date conversion From Bikram Sambat(BS) to English Date(AD) and viceversa.
Conversion is done with the help of date mappings. So, conversion limited to 1971-2100 BS.


## Installation

If you have pip installed, simply
```
pip install pyBSDate
```

OR from source:

1. Get a copy of the project. Download zip of the project or clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/SushilShrestha/pyBSDate
``` 
2. Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder and type
```
python setup.py install
```


## Usage
#### Using functions
```python
# Convert BS Date to AD Date
from pyBSDate import convert_BS_to_AD
ad_date = convert_BS_to_AD(2072, 1, 10)
print(ad_date)

# Convert AD Date to BS
from pyBSDate import convert_AD_to_BS
bs_date = convert_AD_to_BS(2015, 4, 23)
print(bs_date)
```

#### Class based wrappers
`bsdate` and `addate` classes are available for the date conversion. They inherit from the parent `datetime.date` class and all the functions are similar to `datetime.date` class. 

Following code is the example of using the class based date.
```python
from pyBSDate import bsdate

ne_date = bsdate(2077, 2, 32)
print(ne_date.strftime("%B %d %Y, %A", lang='ne'))       # जेष्ठ ३२ २०७७, आइतबार

en_date = ne_date.addate
print (en_date.strftime("%B %d %Y, %A"))                # June 14 2020, Sunday
```

Two date objects can also be compared 
```python
import datetime
from pyBSDate import bsdate, addate

ne_date = bsdate(2077, 2, 32)
en_date = addate(2010, 1, 12)

if ne_date > en_date:
    print(ne_date.isoformat(lang='ne'))
```

Addition or substraction of `timedelta` is also supported 
```python
ne_date = ne_date + datetime.timedelta(days=2)
```
For detailed information, refer to docs.

## Development setup
#### Running test
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```
